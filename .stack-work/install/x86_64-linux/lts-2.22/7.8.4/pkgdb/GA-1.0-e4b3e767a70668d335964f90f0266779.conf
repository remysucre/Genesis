synopsis: Genetic algorithm library
description: This package provides a framework for working with genetic
             algorithms. A genetic algorithm is an evolutionary technique,
             inspired by biological evolution, to evolve entities that perform
             as good as possible in terms of a predefined criterion (the scoring
             function). Note: lower scores are assumed to indicate better entities.
             The GA module provides a type class for defining entities and the
             functions that are required by the genetic algorithm.
             Checkpointing in between generations is available, as is automatic
             restoring from the last available checkpoint.
