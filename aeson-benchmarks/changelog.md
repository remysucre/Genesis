# 0.10.0.1

* Add quotes to surround time encodings.

* Fix toEncoding method for Either

* Fix #293: Bug in TH when omitNothingFields = True.

# 0.10.0.0

## Performance improvements

* Direct encoding via the new `toEncoding` method is over 2x faster
  than `toJSON`.  (You must write or code-gen a `toEncoding`
  implementation to unlock this speedup.  See below for details.)

* Improved string decoding gives a 12% speed win in parsing
  string-heavy JSON payloads (very common).

* Encoding and decoding of time-related types are 10x faster (!!) as a
  result of bypassing `Data.Time.Format` and the arbitrary-precision
  `Integer` type.

* When using `toEncoding`, `[Char]` can be encoded without a conversion to
  `Text`.  This is fast and efficient.

* Parsing into an `Object` is now 5% faster and more
  allocation-efficient.

## SUBTLE API CHANGES, READ CAREFULLY

With the exception of long-deprecated code, the API changes below
**should be upwards compatible** from older versions of `aeson`.  If you run
into upgrade problems, please file an issue with details.

* The `ToJSON` class has a new method, `toEncoding`, that allows
  direct encoding from a Haskell value to a lazy bytestring without
  construction of an intermediate `Value`.

  The performance benefits of direct encoding are significant: more
  than 2x faster than before, with less than 1/3 the memory usage.

  To preserve API compatibility across upgrades from older versions of
  this library, the default implementation of `toEncoding` uses
  `toJSON`.  You will *not* see any performance improvement unless you
  write an implementation of `toEncoding`, which can be very simple:

  ```haskell
  instance ToJSON Coord where
    toEncoding = genericToEncoding defaultOptions
  ```

  (Behind the scenes, the `encode` function uses `toEncoding` now, so
  if you implement `toEncoding` for your types, you should see a
  speedup immediately.)

  If you use Template Haskell or GHC Generics to auto-generate your
  `ToJSON` instances, you'll benefit from fast toEncoding
  implementations for free!

* When converting from a `Value` to a target Haskell type, `FromJSON`
  instances now provide much better error messages, including a
  complete JSON path from the root of the object to the offending
  element.  This greatly eases debugging.

* It is now possible to use Template Haskell to generate `FromJSON`
  and `ToJSON` instances for types in data families.

* If you use Template Haskell or generics, and used to use the
  `camelTo` function to rename fields, the new `camelTo2` function is
  smarter.  For example, `camelTo` will rename `CamelAPICase` to
  `camelapi_case` (ugh!), while `camelTo2` will map it to
  `camel_api_case` (yay!).

* New `ToJSON` and `FromJSON` instances for the following time-related
  types: `Day`, `LocalTime`.

* The `Result` type is now an instance of `Foldable` and `Traversable`.

* The `Data.Aeson.Generic` module has been removed. It was deprecated in
  late 2013.

* GHC 7.2 and older are no longer supported.

* The instance of `Monad` for the `Result` type lacked an implementation
  of `fail` (oops).  This has been corrected.



# 0.9.0.1

* A stray export of `encodeToBuilder` got away!

# 0.9.0.0

* The `json` and `json'` parsers are now synonyms for `value` and
  `value'`, in conformance with the looser semantics of RFC 7159.

* Renamed `encodeToByteStringBuilder` to the more compact
  `encodeToBuilder`.

# 0.8.1.1

* The dependency on the `unordered-containers` package was too lax,
  and has been corrected.

# 0.8.1.0

* Encoding a `Scientific` value with a huge exponent is now handled
  efficiently.  (This would previously allocate a huge
  arbitrary-precision integer, potentially leading to a denial of
  service.)

* Handling of strings that contain backslash escape sequences is
  greatly improved.  For a pathological string containing almost a
  megabyte of consecutive backslashes, the new implementation is 27x
  faster and uses 42x less memory.

* The `ToJSON` instance for `UTCTime` is rendered with higher
  (picosecond) resolution.

* The `value` parser now correctly handles leading whitespace.

* New instances of `ToJSON` and `FromJSON` for `Data.Sequence` and
  `Data.Functor.Identity`.  The `Value` type now has a `Read` instance.

* `ZonedTime` parser ordering now favours the standard `JSON` format,
  increasing efficiency in the common case.

* Encoding to a `Text.Builder` now escapes `'<'` and `'>'` characters,
  to reduce XSS risk.

# 0.8.0.2

* Fix `ToJSON` instance for 15-tuples (see #223).

# 0.8.0.1

* Support `time-1.5`.

# 0.8.0.0

* Add `ToJSON` and `FromJSON` instances for tuples of up to 15
  elements.

# 0.7.1.0

* Major compiler and library compatibility changes: we have dropped
  support for GHC older than 7.4, `text` older than 1.1, and
  `bytestring` older than 0.10.4.0.  Supporting the older versions had
  become increasingly difficult, to the point where it was no longer
  worth it.

# 0.7.0.0

* The performance of encoding to and decoding of bytestrings have both
  improved by up to 2x, while also using less memory.

* New dependency: the `scientific` package lets us parse floating point
  numbers more quickly and accurately.

* `eitherDecode`, `decodeStrictWith`: fixed bugs.

* Added `FromJSON` and `ToJSON` instances for `Tree` and `Scientific`.

* Fixed the `ToJSON` instances for `UTCTime` and `ZonedTime`.

# 0.6 series

* Much improved documentation.

* Angle brackets are now escaped in JSON strings, to help avoid XSS
  attacks.

* Fixed up handling of nullary constructors when using generic
  encoding.

* Added `ToJSON`/`FromJSON` instances for:

  * The `Fixed` class
  * ISO-8601 dates: `UTCTime`, `ZonedTime`, and `TimeZone`

* Added accessor functions for inspecting `Value`s.

* Added `eitherDecode` function that returns an error message if
  decoding fails.

# 0.5 to 0.6

* This release introduces a slightly obscure, but
  backwards-incompatible, change.

  In the generic APIs of versions 0.4 and 0.5, fields whose names
  began with a `"_"` character would have this character removed.  This
  no longer occurs, as it was both buggy and surprising
  (https://github.com/bos/aeson/issues/53).

* Fixed a bug in generic decoding of nullary constructors
  (https://github.com/bos/aeson/issues/62).

# 0.4 to 0.5

* When used with the UTF-8 encoding performance improvements
  introduced in version 0.11.1.12 of the `text` package, this release
  improves `aeson`'s JSON encoding performance by 33% relative to
  `aeson` 0.4.

  As part of achieving this improvement, an API change was necessary.
  The `fromValue` function in the `Data.Aeson.Encode` module now uses
  the `text` package's `Builder` type instead of the `blaze-builder`
  package's `Builder` type.

# 0.3 to 0.4

* The new `decode` function complements the longstanding `encode`
  function, and makes the API simpler.

* New examples make it easier to learn to use the package
  (https://github.com/bos/aeson/tree/master/examples).

* Generics support

  `aeson`'s support for data-type generic programming makes it
  possible to use JSON encodings of most data types without writing
  any boilerplate instances.

  Thanks to Bas Van Dijk, `aeson` now supports the two major schemes
  for doing datatype-generic programming:

  * the modern mechanism, built into GHC itself
	(http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/users_guide/generic-programming.html)

  * the older mechanism, based on SYB (aka "scrap your
	boilerplate")

  The modern GHC-based generic mechanism is fast and terse: in fact,
  its performance is generally comparable in performance to
  hand-written and TH-derived `ToJSON` and `FromJSON` instances.  To
  see how to use GHC generics, refer to `examples/Generic.hs`.

  The SYB-based generics support lives in `Data.Aeson.Generic` and is
  provided mainly for users of GHC older than 7.2.  SYB is far slower
  (by about 10x) than the more modern generic mechanism.  To see how
  to use SYB generics, refer to `examples/GenericSYB.hs`.

* We switched the intermediate representation of JSON objects from
  `Data.Map` to `Data.HashMap` which has improved type conversion
  performance.

* Instances of `ToJSON` and `FromJSON` for tuples are between 45% and 70%
  faster than in 0.3.

* Evaluation control

  This version of aeson makes explicit the decoupling between
  *identifying* an element of a JSON document and *converting* it to
  Haskell.  See the `Data.Aeson.Parser` documentation for details.

  The normal `aeson` `decode` function performs identification
  strictly, but defers conversion until needed.  This can result in
  improved performance (e.g. if the results of some conversions are
  never needed), but at a cost in increased memory consumption.

  The new `decode'` function performs identification and conversion
  immediately.  This incurs an up-front cost in CPU cycles, but
  reduces reduce memory consumption.
