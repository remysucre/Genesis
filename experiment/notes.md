Code coverage: There are 3 factors affecting code coverage: mutation rate, 
population, and number of generation. 

Hint: any annotation already in the source code will be interpreted as hints. 
The annotations are more likely to survive. This is achived by starting the 
first generation by mutating the original source, instead of total randomness. 
This has two benefits: we can add annotations to help the algorithm figure 
out better answer; 
the program wont go bang-crazy and get trapped in infinite loops.
