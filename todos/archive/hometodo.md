intro: who is the tool for
put conclusion first
talk about why we have diversity and not only mutate rate
interpret each parameter concretely for strictness
strictness 
explain that taking original prog doesn't get worse
see if there's a good default for parameters (do experimant on all benchmarks)
  expert users can tune
a formula for choosing the parameter
a short description before everything: it's easy, the user does very little
explaination of diversity go to previous part
have one sentence for each parameter in cfg section then go into detail
changes in parameter has effect 
trade soundness for performance, it is important that the programmer provides
  representative data
calculate from the program the search space, and our coverage space
calculate runtime from sample profiling
check if ICFP will run tool
if new contents add to draft

talk about how we minimize the search space
compare runtime of full search with genetic
explain intuition behind mutation & crossover, with examples
from toy examples. 
explain intuition of impact of parameters on strictness performance. 
look at toy programs, see if we get performance out of soundness. 
discuss toy programs in section 3
train data & real data
