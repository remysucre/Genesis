EXPERIMENTS:
! TODO make Genesis take multiple sources
! TODO figure out all nofib
! TODO get data for all benchmark
! TODO compare with blind random search
! TODO see if there's a good default for parameters (do experimant on all 
       benchmarks) expert users can tune
! TODO calculate from the program the search space, and our coverage space
! TODO calculate runtime from sample profiling
! TODO look @ ML literature for fine-tuning parameters

PAPER: 
intro: who is the tool for
put conclusion first
talk about why we have diversity and not only mutate rate
interpret each parameter concretely for strictness
explain that taking original prog doesn't get worse
a short description before everything: it's easy, the user does very little
explaination of diversity go to previous part
have one sentence for each parameter in cfg section then go into detail
! TODO: talk about archive size
