talk about how we minimize the search space
compare runtime of full search with genetic
explain intuition behind mutation & crossover, with examples
from toy examples. 
explain intuition of impact of parameters on strictness performance. 
look at toy programs, see if we get performance out of soundness. 
discuss toy programs in section 3
train data & real data
